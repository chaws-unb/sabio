-c  Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking stage simply is not done.  The ultimate
           output is in the form of an object file for each source file.

           By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing the suffix .c, .i, .s, etc., with .o.

           Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are ignored.
